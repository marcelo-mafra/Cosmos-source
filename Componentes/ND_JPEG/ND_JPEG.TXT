Installation instructions for TRaveJPEGImage
--------------------------------------------

1: Extract the files in this archive in your Rave main directory
(normally C:\Program Files\Borland\BDS\3.0\RaveReports).  Make sure to expand 
with directories so that the source will be placed in it's own directory.

2: Copy the NDCsJPEG.PAS file into the appropriate directory for the version
of Delphi or C++Builder that you are using (for Delphi 2005 it would normally
be C:\Program Files\Borland\BDS\3.0\RaveReports\lib).

3: Start Rave, go to the preferences dialog (Edit|Preferences), select the
Packages tab and add the C:\Program Files\Borland\BDS\3.0\RaveReports\ND_JPEG.BPL 
package file to the list of installed package and click OK.

That's it.  The only other remaining items that you need to make sure to do is
include the unit NDCsJPEG in the uses clause of your Delphi or C++Builder
application (normally in the same unit containing your TRaveProject component)
and call the RaveRegister procedure inside the NDCsJPEG unit (normally a call
to "NDCsJPEG.RaveRegister;" in the TRaveProject.OnCreate event).  Failure to
follow these two steps will result in runtime errors when loading a report
project (.RAV file) containing TRaveJPEGImage components.
